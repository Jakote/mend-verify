/* ===========================================================================
   THE TOMBSTONE WORKER — served at sw.js on the four retired subdomains.

   Those origins each ran a real service worker that precached the app shell.
   When the apps moved to one origin, the subdomains were given a redirect page
   — and it did not work on the visit that mattered. The installed worker
   answers the navigation from ITS OWN CACHE before the redirect page is ever
   fetched, so a returning visitor got the old, pre-fix app, on a separate
   localStorage island. The third tester reproduced it: visit one is the old
   build with MEND.claimed undefined, visit two is clean.

   Deleting sw.js does not fix that. A 404 does eventually make the browser
   discard the registration, but only AFTER the stale navigation has been
   served, which is exactly one visit too late.

   So the file stays, and becomes a worker whose only job is to die and take
   its caches with it. The browser fetches sw.js on navigation as an update
   check — that request does not go through the old worker — sees a different
   script, installs this, and because it skips waiting and claims the page, it
   is in charge immediately. Then it empties every cache, unregisters itself,
   and sends every open tab to the new address.
